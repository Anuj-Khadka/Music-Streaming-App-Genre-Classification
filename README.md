## General Info
The Music Genre Classifier is a machine learning application that can classify music into different genres with an accuracy of 95%. The application uses a variety of features, such as tempo, pitch, and timbre, to extract information from audio files. This information is then used to train a machine learning model, which can then be used to predict the genre of a new audio file.
The Music Genre Classifier can be used by music lovers, musicologists, and music retailers to help them identify and categorize music. The application can also be used to create personalized playlists, recommend new music, and track trends in music genres.
The Music Genre Classifier is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the way we listen to music. By automating the process of genre classification, the Music Genre Classifier frees up users to focus on the more enjoyable aspects of music listening, such as discovering new artists and exploring new genres.
